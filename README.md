# toy_takeoff_modeling

A dumb/hacky but hopefully useful toy model of [AI takeoff](https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/ai-takeoff).

Code written by Eli Lifland. Building off a weekend project in which I collaborated with J.J. Andrade, Trevor Levin, and Katherine Chou.

To run, clone this repo then install pyenv and poetry then:
```
pyenv install 3.9.5 && pyenv local 3.9.5
poetry install
poetry run python run_takeoff_model.py
```

With default settings the model outputs something like:
```
TODO
```
